# WaiterHub

WaiterHub is a full-stack application designed to streamline restaurant management, including user authentication, order processing, and product management. The project is divided into two main parts: a backend (Node.js, Express, Prisma, Docker) and a frontend (React, Vite, Redux, Tailwind CSS).

## Project Structure

- `backend/` — REST API built with Node.js, Express, and Prisma ORM.
- `frontend/` — Modern web client built with React and Vite.
